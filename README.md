# Overview of PyBer Fare Data
##Reason for Analysis 
The goal of this analysis is to see the pricing, driver, and duration differences in driving services provided in urban, suburban, and rural cities. 

##Results of Analysis
###Fares
When reviewing the total fares for each city type, we can see that rural makes the least, followed by suburban, and then urban, which is to be expected logically. What is a bit more attention grabbing is when looking at the fares per driver, we see a large difference in the three. They show rural paying the most per ride on average and urban paying far less on average, with suburban again falling in the middle.

What this may be pointing to, is a need for more drivers in the rural area. Although the market is smaller, the density of the averages could be showing the drivers transporting more than the optimal amount of passengers on a given shift. The inverse may be true for urban. There may be too many drivers. This is also seen in the raw number of drivers. There are 125 rides in rural cities, but 78 drivers. While in urban areas, there are 1625 rides but 2405 drivers

##Summary
I would suggest looking to make these changes
Increase the number of drivers in rural cities 
Decrease the number of drivers in urban cities 
Slighlty increase the amount charged in urban cities

This would likely lead to smoother transactions for rural customers (less wait times for riders), better distribute the pay for urban drivers, and help offset the work increase for urban drivers due to the slight increase in cost of service. And since it seems there are already too many drivers in urban areas, there should not be a decrease in quality of service to the riders (wait time)
